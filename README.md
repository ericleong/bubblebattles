bubblebattles
=============
A hackNY Fall 2012 hack focused on bringing bubble consumption to the world of massive multiplayer online games!

Inspired by [Bubbles](http://www.fullstackoptimization.com/bubbles/) and built on top of [thegrid](https://github.com/azlyth/thegrid)

To get started simply install the dependencies, 
  
    npm install

if necessary, change the `host` in `grid-client.js`, or set the `DOMAIN` environment variable. The port can also be set with the `PORT` environment variable. Then start the server with 

    $ node grid-server.js

and visit 

	localhost:8080

in your browser (or the hostname you set).
