bubblebattles
=============
A hackNY Fall 2012 hack focused on bringing bubble consumption to the world of massive multiplayer online games!

Inspired by [Bubbles](http://www.fullstackoptimization.com/bubbles/) and built on top of [thegrid](https://github.com/azlyth/thegrid)

To get started simply install the dependencies, 
  
    npm install

if necessary, change the `host` in `grid-client.js`. Then start the server

    node grid-server.js

and visit 

	localhost:8080

or the host you selected in your browser.
